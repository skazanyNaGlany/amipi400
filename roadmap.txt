1. When mounted empty (no .adf files) ARA_DF0 (0-4) partition - create empty .adf 
file; customization by ENABLE_CREATE_ADF option
2. DONE: Ability to load extended rom file (for CD32)
3. DONE: Ability to load .iso file from ARA_CD0 (0-4) and cdimage0 config option; same feature
as loading .adf file(s) from ARA_DF0
